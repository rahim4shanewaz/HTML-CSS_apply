					<h2>About <span class="comla">Us</span></h2>
					 <p>This  is a non-profit organization that aims to create a positive impact on the lives of children, women and families   who are in need. We help meet basic needs in the lives of vulnerable groups by creating campaigns, partnerships with major brands and ambassadors and beneficiary institutions and other institutions that promote an impact of social transformation. The Foundation works in two ways- it finances the projects of third party non-profit organiza­tions or individuals in dire need due to their circumstances or financing its own in house projects, such as Casa Ángeles.</p><br/>
